## Fulltimeforce: Technical Evaluation

##### Objective: The goal of this test will be to create an app that shows git commit history on the same project you are working on.

Implementation: This app has been developed using Reactjs and Redux. The initial values come from a 'demo' object with the following values ```{username: 'EliasBobadilla', repo: 'Fulltimeforce'}```

You can enter a github username in the username field and click on the 'search' button to change the current user, the list of repositories of the queried user will be filled automatically.

You can select a repository from the repository field to view the commit history for selected repository.

To setup your local environment for this project you need to clone this project and then perform ```npm install``` in the current project folder, then perform ```npm start``` to run the app on port 3000 on your localhost

To generate the project documentation you can perform ```npm run docs```, the generated documentation will be found in: '/Fulltimeforce/fulltimeforce-app/docs/index.html'
